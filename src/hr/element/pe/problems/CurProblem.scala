/**
  In England the currency is made up of pound, F, and pence, p, and there are
    eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, F1 (100p) and F2 (200p).

  It is possible to make F2 in the following way:
    1*F1 + 1*50p + 2*20p + 1*5p + 1*2p + 3*1p

  How many different ways can F2 be made using any number of coins?
